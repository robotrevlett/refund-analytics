## App Name
Refund & Return Analytics

## Tagline (100 characters max)
See your real revenue after refunds. Track returns by date, product, and reason.

## Description (500 characters max)
Shopify shows gross sales — but what actually hits your bank account? Refund & Return Analytics shows your real net revenue by grouping refunds by refund date (not order date), so you see the true impact on each period. Get per-product refund breakdowns, track return reasons (sizing, quality, accuracy), and spot trends before they become problems. Built for stores with 50+ orders/month who need accurate P&L data.

## Key Benefits
1. **Real net revenue** — See what actually hits your bank account, not inflated gross sales
2. **Refund date attribution** — Refunds shown by when they happened, not when the order was placed
3. **Per-product breakdown** — Know exactly which products are bleeding money from returns
4. **Return reason analytics** — Track why customers return (sizing, quality, accuracy, preference)
5. **Automatic sync** — Data stays current via Shopify webhooks with bulk initial import
